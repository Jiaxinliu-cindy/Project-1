<h1>
    Sugar's Story
</h1>
<p>
    Dogs have been a huge part of my entire family. 
    I got my first puppy in Beijing when I was in sixth grade. After I
    moved to the U.S. for high school, my father moved to Southern California 
    by himself and my mother decided to stay in Beijing. It was the beginning 
    of my family’s separation. Two countries, three time zones. Communication
     and keeping each other, the two simplest things for families, became
      the most difficult things for us to accomplish. Because of that, my 
      Dad brought home two new family members one day and named them Sugar
       and Ginger. That day, our family group chat kept on ringing as my Dad 
       would send multiple pictures every hour. I could tell, he was excited.
</p>

<p>
    Sugar and Ginger were about three months old when they first came to our
     house. They were about the size of my Dad’s hand. My Dad said 
     he would take Sugar and Ginger in his jacket’s pockets when
     he goes out for grocery shopping. Because of Sugar and Ginger, my dad
      would always be the center of attention in stores as people would always
     be surprised by the fact that they are actually real. It was my high school
     junior year’s spring break when I first met Sugar
       and Ginger. With their company, the house was filled with laughter and 
       happiness every day. One of Sugar’s favorite activity was chasing and
        barking at my Dad’s golf clubs. She would also put on a show of the dog 
        version of the tug of war with Ginger when they fight for toys. 
        When it was sunny outside, they enjoyed walking alongside the beach with 
        my Dad every afternoon and would always wait for their small treats when 
        they get home to end the day. 
</p>



<p>
    Sugar was the sweetest dog. She kept my Dad during his ups and downs.
     She had a signature pair of round and watery eyes that always had 
     something to say. She could be a little silly sometimes so we would 
     call her Xiao Sha Zi or Xiao Hanhan (小傻子，小憨憨). She had a curious
      mind and loved to explore the surroundings around her.  She was loved
       and protected by everyone in the family and she would always greet
        guests and friends with her kindness and innocence.
</p>

<p>Sugar went through a tough life filled with illnesses but she always
     stayed strong and hopeful. It was one afternoon that I received a 
     text from my Dad during my Squash practice. He said that Sugar was
      paralyzed because an extra bone grew out on her neck and affected
    her nerves. The vet told us it was very unlikely that she would
    recover fully. Even with surgery, she lower half of the body would
     still be paralyzed. That day, it was the first that I heard my Dad
    cried in years. He struggled so much because Sugar was so young and 
    he did not want to see her go through so much pain for the rest of her
     life, but at the same time, it kills him to even think about sending her
      away with euthanasia. After trying everything we could, my Dad decided 
      to not go through with the surgery and started to consider euthanasia. 
      But a miracle happened. Right after we gave up on surgery, the vet gave
       Sugar a hormone medicine. He was not positive that it would change
        anything but would not hurt to give a last try. One day after the
         medicine, Sugar was able to stand up and walk slowly. </p>

<p>
    We always say, “you never know which one comes first, tomorrow or
     accidents.” Around 7 pm, April 29th. Sugar was attacked by a coyote
      when she was playing with Ginger in our backyard. We got lucky that
       the coyote actually dropped her on the ground due to their fear of 
       humans. My parents wrapped Sugar’s wounds immediately and drove to 
       emergency care within 20 minutes. My Mom said that Sugar stayed strong 
       with her eyes open in her arms. My parents called me after handing Sugar 
       to the vet. I felt like my entire world collapsed after hearing the news. 
       I prayed and wished for a miracle to happen but did not get any other 
       calls from my parents for the next half an hour. I knew exactly what 
       happened. More than an hour later, I received a text from my Mom, 
       “Sugar left us.” That night, I cried until I fell asleep.
