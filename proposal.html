    <h1>Project Proposal - Jiaxin (Cindy) Liu</h1>
<br>
<div>
    <h2>About the Website</h2>
    <p>For the project I have decided to make a memorial website for my dog, Sugar,
        who passed away about a month ago. This website will be all about Sugar, 
        and her life with us. I want to use text, pictures, and videos to tell her story
        and everything that she has been through. Ever since she passed away, my family and I 
        have been finding different ways to document her life so I thought this project
        would be a perfect opportunity for me.
      </p>
   
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
    <p><li>The main objective of this website is create an online tribute for Sugar.
        So, my family and I can have a place to see her when we miss her. </li>
    </p>
    <p> <li>This website is also created for my father. He raised Sugar all by himself for the 
        past two years. When my mom and I were away, it was Sugar and Ginger who kept him 
        company. He treated Sugar like his own daughter so he has been going through a 
        really hard time after Sugar passed away. I want to give this website to him as a gift 
        for his upcoming birthday.</li>
</p>
    <p><li>This website will also be used as a coyotes information page for our neighbors
        and other California residences. Since we live near the coyotes cliff and a few other
        household's pet dogs' lives were also taken by coyotes. I want to raise awareness through this 
        web page and inform people about the harms coyotes can bring to families so that others would 
        not have to go through the same tragedy we did. </li>   
    </p></ol>
    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>The main target audience would be my family since this is a memorial page for our dog. My secondary 
        target audience would be our neighbors because our properties are located near the field where most
        coyotes live in. If possible, I would also want to expand my target audiences to the greater areas of 
        California.
    </p>
    <h2>Contents</h2>
    <p>I will have three pages that talk about Sugar's life time. One page will focus on her childhood, when 
        she first came to my family. Another page will document the hard times that she has been through such as,
        her illnesses and her death. The third page will focus on pictures of my family and her and also picture of her
        and her sister, Ginger. For the forth page, I want to focus on basic information about coyotes in California, including
        there habitats, habits, harms and ways to protect pet animals and ourselves when facing coyotes' attacks.
