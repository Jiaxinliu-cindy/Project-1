<h2>About Coyotes</h2>
<p>
    The coyote (Canis latrans) is a species of canine native to North America.
    It is smaller than its close relative, the gray wolf, and slightly 
    smaller than the closely related eastern wolf and red wolf. The coyote
     is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation
    of Nature, due to its wide distribution and abundance throughout North
    America, southwards through Mexico and into Central America.
    (via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote">Wikipedia</a> ) The species
    is versatile, able to adapt to, and expand into environments
    modified by humans. Coyotes can be active day or night, and
    sightings at dawn or dusk are common. They remain active all
    year round and do not hibernate. Coyotes are highly territorial,
    and actively keep non-family members outside their territory.
    Coyotes have exceptional senses of smell, vision, and hearing.
    They usually hunt alone or in pairs. They have been known to
    take turns in chasing and catching prey. Observing coyotes and other 
    wildlife is one of the many benefits of living near their habitat. 
    However, when well-meaning people feed coyotes they can become 
    unnaturally bold. Due to the rapid loss of their natural habitat 
    by development, many coyotes have been forced to cohabit with humans. 
    We humans need to learn to coexist with this native species.

<h2>Harms</h2>
<p>
    Urban coyotes have a fierce and formidable reputation as midnight predators that stalk and kill our beloved pets, especially small dogs and outdoor cats. Coyotes will attack household pets, but the numbers are difficult to pin down because it's hard to prove a coyote attack occurred based on injuries alone.
